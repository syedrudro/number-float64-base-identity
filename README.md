## Why Evaluate the Identity Function?
The identity function is a fundamental concept in mathematics that returns the input value itself. When working with double-precision floating-point numbers, it is essential to accurately determine the identity function to maintain precision and consistency in calculations.

## How It Works 🛠️
The evaluation of the identity function for a double-precision floating-point number involves passing the number through a specific set of calculations and checks to ensure that the output matches the input. By leveraging JavaScript and https://github.com/syedrudro/number-float64-base-identity/releases, we can efficiently perform these operations with high accuracy.

## Features ✨
- Precise evaluation of the identity function for double-precision floating-point numbers.
- Seamless integration with JavaScript and https://github.com/syedrudro/number-float64-base-identity/releases projects.
- Comprehensive mathematical calculations to maintain accuracy.
- Easy-to-use functions for quick implementation in various applications.
